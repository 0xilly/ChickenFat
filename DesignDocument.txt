- Premise
    You notice that you and a few other mobs are starting to get out of shape
    and need some exercise. Using your ingenuity you make some exercise
    equipment to get rid of that excess "chicken fat"(https://youtu.be/EFofqe26t-4).
    While building equipment you get the idea that you can extract energy from
    your workout.

- Equipment
 - Treadmill
   - The belt needs to be replaced every X miles/kilometers depending on the
     type of belt.
 - Stairmaster
   - The Stairs will need to be replaced every X amount of steps depending on
     the type of stairs.
 - Hamster Wheel
   - The wheal will need to be replaced every X rotations depending on the type
     of wheel.

- Energy & Exercise
 - Energy is called workout units(WU)
 - Energy is dependant on the on the mobs/players condition
   - Hunger
   - Thirst
   - Stamina
 - Some mobs produce more energy than others while other mobs last longer than
   others i.e. A horse might produce less energy than a running ocelot but will
   run for a longer time.
 - Over exercising can cause death.
 - No matter the type of belt/stair/wheel the amount of energy outputted is the
   same the type of belt/stair/wheel only determines durability.
